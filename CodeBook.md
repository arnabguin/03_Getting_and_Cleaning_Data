tidyDataSet contains the means of all the columns in the data set

Reading the training feature set encountered issues in the number of rows read. But I tested the program using a sample of the feature set and it printed out hte results correctly.

Somehow, the read.csv function when reading UCI/train/X_train.txt is giving 11K+ rows which is higher than 7352 (expected)
